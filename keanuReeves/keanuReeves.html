            <h4>About Keanu</h4>
            <p>
                 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Born on September 2, 2019. Keanu Reeves is of Chinese, Hawaiian and European descent. His name translates to 'Cool Breeze Over the Mountains'. Keanu Reeves is a well-respected actor in Hollywood. He is most known for his roles in the series 'The Matrix', 'Speed', and 'John Wick'. He has rightfully earned 'Best On-Screen Duo' with Sandra Bullock in Speed, 'Best Male Performance, Favourite Actor and Fight Scene' in 'The Matrix'. He also has the reputation of being genorous giving to causes well-known or not.

            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, you can't be Keanu in-game sadly, but you can be friends with him! Keanu Reeves will play as digital hallucination of the main character. Johnny Silverhand is a musical artist in a band called 'Samurai'. He's a rebel of the military who protests through music. When Keanu Reeves was approached he accepted the role and was ask for his input in how the role should be implemented. More to come...

            <h4>My Opinion</h4>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm so happy so see such a classy actor be involved in the video game industry. Many occurences of actor's being involved in video games sometimes don't workout such as Hideo Kojima's Death Stranding where people were excited to see actor Norman Reedus to be the face of the game only to be letdown in gameplay. Having a Keanu in a promising game is something new. Having Keanu be the face of the game will only do positive.
