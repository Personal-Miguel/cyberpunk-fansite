                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cyberpunk 2077 is available for pre-order but you may ask yourself, is it worth purchasing before the final product? Well if you enjoyed the previous content on this site, such as the storyline or features, you may want to consider the deals below. However, you might not be so concrete on what to purchase and that's where I can help. 
            </p>
            
            <!--A list for the user about the different deals and my opinion on them for them to use as a guide-->
            <ul>        
                <li>
                    The Standard Edition of the game is with minimal extras containing art and stickers apart from the game itself and is for those simply interested in the game alone. Unfortunately for PC players, all vendors sell the standard game at the same price at $79.99. However,  for PS4/XBOX player,  Amazon sells it at  $64.96 which I highly recommend.
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    Now, there's the Collector's Edition geared towards those who dream about Cyberpunk 2077. It includes extras such as a miniature statue, a special box for the game, keychains, art, a bag and other little goodies. I will only recommend it those who REALLY want the game and have a wallet to support it as Best Buy and Walmart sells it for $325.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Amazon also sells an official guide which may be an interest to you as it expands on the many concepts of the game. Though it is written to avoid spoilers, the disadvantage of purchasing the guide is that it spoils the thrill and surprise of the little in-game concepts like missions, rewards and at a price of $50 is really worth it to be ahead of the game? I don't think so...
