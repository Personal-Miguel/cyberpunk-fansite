                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much is still in the workds within Cyberpunk 2077 but from gamplay demo, this is what I've gathered. You can check out the demo that contains the some of the story in the video.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
                
            </p>
            <br>
                
            <h4>Settings & History</h4>
            <p>
                 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The game will take place in a fictional city called 'Night City' in 2077. Nighht City is a dystopia where technology is no longer a tool but an obsession, in which many citizens of Night City will implments cybernetic enhancements excessively. Night City once went through a period of economic instability. The currency is 'Eddies. The protagonist 'V' lives in the district Watson. A district named Pacifica houses two gangs: the Animals and the Voodoo Boys. Pacifica is a very unsafe place as it was meant to be tourist attraction but through construction, the period of economic crisis mentioned occured leaving Pacifica to rot.
            </p>    
                    
            <h4>Character</h4>
            <p>
                 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You will play protagonist the 'V', a citizen of Night City involved in gang warfare. You have a digital hallucination of a character Johnny Silverhand who is to act as your guide, if you choose to do so. A man named the 'Ripper Doc' is available to modify "V's" cybernetic enhancements. You will end up doing jobs for military agent Stout and crime lord Dexter Deshawn. Within those jobs, you are to steal technology or terminate gangs, again if you choose to do so, or go against them. What you choose will affect your in-game reputation changing how non-playable characters interact with you. <br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The gang 'Voodoo Boys' are from Haitan descent who moved to Pacifica during natural disaster. They're most adept using technology. The gang 'The Animals' are led by a being named 'Sasquatch'. The gang itself shamelessely pushing the limits in cybernetically enhancing themselves.

            <h4>My Opinion</h4>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still to little to determine whether the storyline will make or break the game, but from what I see I have never seen a concept like this before. I'm excited to see what's to come.
