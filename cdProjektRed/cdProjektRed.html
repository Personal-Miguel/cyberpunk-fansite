                        CDProjektRed is a subgroup of the company CDProjekt. CD standing for central distribution and RED to distinguish the studio from the parent company. CD Projekt is also the parent of the online video game vendor GOG.com. Founded by Michał Kiciński and Marcin Iwiński in 2002, the CDProjektRed studio was built in Poland. From there, they released a game called 'The Witcher' in 2007. 'The Witcher' was very well received thus pushing CDProjektRed to release many sequels to the game. Since Then the CDProjekt crew grew from a skeleton group in Poland to a global company. Their second separate title is 'Cyberpunk 2077' is to be released in April 2020.

                    <p> There is an inner fire, fueled in every member of the studio. It comes from what we surround ourselves with, from the games we play, from where we live and who we are accompanied by.
                        We want to hone that fire and make it grow. It’s what makes the games we create so unique. As a studio, we have one mission: making the best video games on the planet.
                        We want to tell breathtaking, mature stories to global audiences, without losing the attention to detail that has made us who we are today. - CDProjekt Red Website

                        I am very much ecstatic about the growth of CDProjektRed and what it brings to Cyberpunk 2077. CD Projekt Red has been a classy company for years without any significant community backlash. The company has kept microtransaction at a respectable amount giving the players that they truly have a passion for games rather than money. The company has released the Witcher as their only series which is very successful, and with such a clean and simple record it's impossible to imagine a ride from a minimal company in 2007 to gaining CAD 25 million in the first quarter of 2018 with so little hiccups. One can only imagine what is to come or Cyberpunk 2077.
